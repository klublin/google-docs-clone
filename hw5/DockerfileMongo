FROM mongo
COPY factbook /lib/
COPY script.sh /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d

#I copied into tmp, think reason is because root isn't initlaized so the factbook.json doesn't get there fast 
#enough. "shrug" idrk, but anyways, script.sh is copied into that specific directory because it is automatically 
#ran when docker container starts up, pretty neat
